<h2>801. Minimum Swaps To Make Sequences Increasing</h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><div><p>We have two integer sequences <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> of the same non-zero length.</p>

<p>We are allowed to swap elements <code>A[i]</code> and <code>B[i]</code>.&nbsp; Note that both elements are in the same index position in their respective sequences.</p>

<p>At the end of some number of swaps, <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are both strictly increasing.&nbsp; (A sequence is <em>strictly increasing</em> if and only if <code>A[0] &lt; A[1] &lt; A[2] &lt; ... &lt; A[A.length - 1]</code>.)</p>

<p>Given A and B, return the minimum number of swaps to make both sequences strictly increasing.&nbsp; It is guaranteed that the given input always makes it possible.</p>

<pre><strong>Example:</strong>
<strong>Input:</strong> A = [1,3,5,4], B = [1,2,3,7]
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation: </strong>
Swap A[3] and B[3].  Then the sequences are:
A = [1, 3, 5, 7] and B = [1, 2, 3, 4]
which are both strictly increasing.
</pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>A, B</code> are arrays with the same length, and that length will be in the range <code>[1, 1000]</code>.</li>
	<li><code>A[i], B[i]</code> are integer values in the range <code>[0, 2000]</code>.</li>
</ul>
